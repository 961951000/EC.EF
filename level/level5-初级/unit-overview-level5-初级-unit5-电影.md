### 描述一部电影
I just saw 'Rear Window.' What an amazing movie! 'Rear Window' was made in 1954 and was directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock. 'Rear Window' is a dark story, like most Hitchcock movies. L.B. is played by James Stewart. L.B. is a photographer, but his leg is broken. He has to stay home, so he watches his neighbors through their windows. I felt sorry for his poor neighbors! Soon, L.B. begins using his camera to fight evil. I saw the remake in 1998, but it's not the same. Daryl Hannah's acting was dreadful!
