# 金钱和购买

## 挑选产品
### 有很多形容词您可以用来描述产品。一种牢记它们的方式就是学习它们的同时掌握它们的反义词。
- old - new
- slow - fast
### 当使用一个以上的形容词时，用and 或 一个逗号( , )分开它们。
- My desktop computer's really old **and** slow. I need a new, fast laptop.
### 很多形容词有一个以上的反义词。这些反义词可以有相同或不同的意思。这里有一些不同形容词有相同意思的例子。
- attractive - unattractive
- attractive - ugly
- safe - unsafe
- safe - dangerous
### 在使用形容词cheap时要小心。它可以指便宜也可以形容做工差。
- expensive - inexpensive
- expensive - cheap
- That's a cheap price. Buy it!
- That computer looks cheap. Don't buy it.
### 当两个人或两个事物进行比较时，形容词变成比较级，并跟着than。对于单音节的形容词的比较级是加-er。
- slow > slow**er than**
- The desktop computer is **slower than** the laptop computer.
### 对于两个或两个以上的音节的形容词，用more or less + adjective + than。形容词不变。
- expensive > more expensive than / less expensive than
- The laptop computer is **more expensive than** the desktop.
- The desktop computer is **less expensive than** the laptop. 
### 如果听者已经知道您在说什么了，那么句子中的 than 这个部分可以省掉。
- My old computer is slow. I need something **faster**. (than my old computer)
- You can buy a desktop or a laptop computer.
- The laptop is **more expensive**. (than the desktop computer)

## 购买
### 使用动词 need、want 和 like 搭配不定式 (to + verb) 做陈述。下列陈述中不定式的例子是 to get、to buy 和 to play。
- I **need to get** a new computer.
- I **want to buy** a new tablet.
- I **like to play** computer games.
- He **doesn't like to play** computer games.
### 有时候不定式动词可以省掉，陈述句仍具有相同意思。
- I **need** a new computer.
- I **want** a new tablet.
- I **like** computer games.
- He **doesn't like** computer games.
### 您也可以用need, want and like 加动词不定式发问和回答问题。
- What do you **need to do**?
- I **need to clean** my apartment.
- What do you **want to do**?

### 请记住规则的形容词是单音节的，词尾加上-er 变成比较级。

- cheap > cheap**er** than
- The cellphone is **cheaper than** the smartphone. 
### 对于短的形容词以e结尾的加-r。

### 对于短的形容词以一个元音字母然后一个辅音字母结尾的，双写辅音字母。
- bi**g** > bi**gg**er than
### 对于短的和长的形容词以y结尾的，把y 改为i 再加-er。
- eas**y** > eas**ier** than
- prett**y** > prett**ier** than

### 然而，不规则形容词比较级不用词根。

- **Ouch! That hurts**.
### 我们生活所需的费用称为cost of living。

### 不是所有的形容词都能通过加-ly变成副词的。这里有三个重要的例子：
