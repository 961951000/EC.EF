Davy, thanks for joining me for the lesson “Television.” In this role play, your job was to explain what you wanted to watch on TV and why. You worked hard in the lesson, and in the end, we were able to choose something to watch together. I would encourage you to continue practicing this conversation so that you are more natural. Use the online study tools for help with vocabulary and grammar. Have a great weekend. Karen R.

强项:You were able to name some different kinds of TV shows.

有待改善的方面:An area to work on is pronunciation. Work on speaking at a faster pace. Also, work on saying things more clearly; this did lead to some misunderstandings during the lesson. For example, I heard you say “I can’t understand…,” but you actually said “I can’t stand….” That complete sentence should be “I can’t stand sitcoms.”
