强项:You are able to understand instructions and respond appropriately, which is wonderful.

有待改善的方面:Please use the future progressive tense (e.g. 'I will be doing') to describe activities that will be happening, or will be in progress, at a specific time in the future. For Example You said: "This time next year I want to be getting a promotion" Please work on those dental consonants sounds you have trouble pronouncing, such as: G, D, T, etc, as will assist people in hearing exactly what you’re trying to communicate.
