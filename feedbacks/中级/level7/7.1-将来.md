Davy, today we had a lesson on "Task 1 Talking about cars and the environment". It was an interesting topic and we worked very well together. You were very attentive and made sure that you understood every question and instruction before proceeding. I hope to see you again in another lesson. Good luck with your English studies. If you have any questions or would like me to book a lesson for you, send me the times and dates that you’d like me to book the lesson/s for you. You can email me on (Mbali.mahlangu@ef.com)

强项:I was impressed when you said, “They are dangerous sometimes.” I feel that you are very expressive and you are able to bring your ideas across very well. Keep up the good work.

有待改善的方面:You said, “I'm feeling negative because it can make air decreasing.” rather say, “I'm feeling negative because it can make the air quality to decrease.” Please continue to increase your (vocabulary/grammar point) by using the online study tools.
