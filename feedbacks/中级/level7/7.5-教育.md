Davy Cai, today we had a lesson on "Education". It was an interesting topic and we worked very well together. You were very attentive and made sure that you understood every question and instruction before proceeding. I hope to see you again in another lesson. Good luck with your English studies. If you have any questions or would like me to book a lesson for you, send me the times and dates that you’d like me to book the lesson/s for you. You can email me on (lerato.mokone@ef.com)
