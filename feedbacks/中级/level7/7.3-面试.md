强项:When you spoke in short and simple sentences, you were able to express yourself pretty clearly.

有待改善的方面:Be careful with using the word "have" as it has a different function depending on if you're using it as the active verb or if you're using it in a Present Perfect sentence. The online study tools can help more.
