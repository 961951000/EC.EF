The City's Dark Future

'City Dark,' Cable 12's new police drama, is set in Chicago in the year 2050. In the first episode, Detective Ella Washington is walking down the stairs to her apartment when she finds a man who has been murdered. This isn't unusual, as the city has become more violent and dangerous. But two hours later, a woman is found dead in the apartment building of Ella's colleague, Dallas. Dallas tells Ella that the man and the woman had been in a 12-year relationship and had just decided to separate.

The plot was certainly fascinating. And here's an example of the dialogue, which was often weird but realistic:

Ella: They were a couple? You mean, like, in a relationship?

Dallas: Married, in love, engaged or just romantic friends – I don't know. But they were definitely in a relationship.
```

```markdown
If you don't see every episode, you won't understand the story.

The dialogue is very realistic. It reminds me of things that I say!

The show is set in New York.

A police detective tries to solve a violent murder.

Logan and Ava were always fighting, so they've separated.

Each episode of this police show begins with a murder.

```markdown
I'm amazed at how violent TV is in the US. Some detective programs show all the details of people getting shot. You see fighting on the news every day. Some cable channels even show real people getting murdered. I feel strongly that the rating system doesn't always help, because children are sometimes home by themselves and can watch what they want. Basically, TV is violent, but I think we can make it better. We need to stop watching these violent programs and demand more educational ones.
```

### 最终任务-撰写有关你所在国家的电视的文章

```markdown
I feel strongly that there should be a limit on how much violence is shown on TV. For example, lots of crime shows have killings, shootings and other violent crimes, all right around the time that families eat dinner together. In my opinion, this is not suitable for family entertainment. I don't think we should eliminate violence from TV altogether, but we need to move the more violent shows to a later time, when younger viewers are likely to be asleep.
