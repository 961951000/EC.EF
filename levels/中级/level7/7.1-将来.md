City Builds Electric Car Charging Stations
By Tarana Anand

People can now charge their electric cars in the city parking lot.

"We've built two charging stations for electric cars," said city engineer Randolph Schmidt. "If people use more clean electricity for cars and less dirty gasoline, we can decrease air pollution."

Alma Torres commutes 80 kilometers a day to her bank job in her electric car. "The city charging stations are wonderful. They show that the city cares about saving the environment around us," she said.

The city is also serious about improving water and air quality, Schmidt said. Last year, the city stopped using coal. Now, natural gas powers all city buildings.

### 表达-谈论人们的观点

- a very different idea of the future
- Many people are pessimistic.
- all of the speakers
- For them, the future's incredible.
- The speakers talked about ...

### 阅读-阅读有关未来生活的文章

```markdown
1. The speakers at the Bright Ideas conference last year gave optimistic ideas about the future. I liked what Henrik Mayer said. He believes that technology will provide more health services to people who live far from hospitals. If a sick person has a mobile phone, the doctors will use teleconferencing technology to help sick people by phone. This seems realistic, and it will help people have fewer health problems in the future.
2. I read a university report that said that developing countries, the US and Europe strongly disagree about pollution laws. The report said that developing countries will create more pollution than other countries because they have fewer laws about air and water quality. The report is very pessimistic, but I think it is also realistic. I believe that world leaders need to meet and discuss this, or we will have terrible environmental problems.
3. A German CEO says that Africa will be a huge market for computer businesses. The CEO believes that African economies will grow by 100% by the year 2050. I am also optimistic about Africa, but it's not realistic that the economy will grow 100% in such a short time. Africa needs fewer laws that hurt business before the economy will grow that quickly.
```

### 最终任务-撰写有关未来的文章

```markdown
I'm generally very optimistic about the future. I believe that gasoline will be gone by the year 2100. I think that's completely realistic. We will use the sun and wind for electricity, and most cars will be electric cars. A scientist at Sunlight Motors demonstrated an electric car that can go almost 250 kilometers between charges. Many people are buying electric cars now. I think that pollution will decrease a lot over the next 10 or 20 years. Life will be good in the future.
