# 教育

## 1-描述你的教育背景

### 词汇-学校词汇

#### *University* 与 *college*

- 在美国，**college** 经常为提供文科学历的一个单独的学院；而 **university** 则拥有多个学院（工程学院、法学院等）。美国人提及两者时均用 **college**，除非他们正在谈论某个特定的大学。 使用 university 时，通常在其前面加上一个冠词，如 **the**。
  - I'm **going to college** in the fall.
  - They both went to **Pacific University**.
  - We play on the volleyball team at **the university**.
- 在英国，**college** 通常是接受继续教育或职业教育的地方；而 **university** 则是攻读本科学位或研究生学位的地方。这两个词语通常均不与冠词 **the** 一起使用。
  - I'm going to **university** in the autumn.
  - I went to **college** to study computer programming.
- 在美国，学生们说他们 **in college**；而在英国，学生们则说他们 **at university**。
  - Paul and his sister are both **in college**.
  - Paul and his sister are both **at university**.

```markdown
Most Americans start their education at age 5 or 6, in elementary school. Then they graduate to middle school, and finally high school. Each year of education is called a grade. Each school may be different, but grades 1 through 5 are usually elementary school, grades 6 through 8 middle school, and grades 9 through 12 high school.

After high school, students can choose to go to a university or college. Universities are larger than colleges and offer more degrees, like a bachelor's or master's degree. Colleges usually offer only bachelor's degrees.

Students can go to public schools, which are paid for by state taxes, or families can pay for their children to go to private schools, which some people believe offer a better education, but are usually more expensive.

### 口语-句子重音

#### 句子重音

- 为进行有效的沟通，在说每个句子中最重要的词语时需大声一点，以予以强调。注意，**private** 和 **expensive** 在此句子中重读：
  - **Private** schools are too **expensive**.
- 注意，**high** 和 **university** 在此句子中重读：
  - After **high** school, I went to a private **university**.
- 你可以通过重读不同的词语，改变句子的含义。注意，如果 **private** 而不是 **university** 被重读，句子的含义会如何变化。说话人让“大学是私立的”比“她上过大学”这一事实显得重要。
  - After **high** school, I went to a **private** university.
- 除了 **private** 之外，如果说话人还重读 **I**，注意句子意思是如何改变的。现在，说话人强调她上了一所私立大学，而也许其他人没有。
  - After **high** school, **I** went to a **private** university.

It's Test Time
by Alicia Robins


It's August, and people are going back to college. They're also taking a lot of English language tests.

"The trend in language education is to give students tests many times a year," said Trevor Burke, City College president. "In the 1990s, we only gave tests once a year."

The tests help the college figure out which students need special language classes, he said.

"If the student passes the test, he can continue in his regular classes." But what happens if the student doesn't pass? What if the student fails?

"If the student fails, there are special classes that can help," Burke said. "Or, sometimes, he can take the test again."
```

  - It's **not unusual to** study all night before a test.

### 表达-就某个问题表明立场

### 阅读-美国的教育

```markdown
I'm in favor of technology in education and, in fact, it's quite common for US colleges to use technology. For example, it's not unusual for students to get degrees online. I'm not surprised, because you can study whenever and wherever you want. Another trend is that students are buying electronic books, or e-books. I totally support the use of e-readers. You can read them on a mobile device – paper books are too heavy to carry! Also, I think it's wrong that paper books cost more than e-books. It's not unusual to pay $100 for a paper book. I'm all for technology in education. I just wish that technology could help me pass Monday's test in math class!

Class: Trends in Education
Professor Wilson



Assignment: Read the proposal below. Then write your opinion, taking a stand. Support your opinion.



Proposal: Our school committee has proposed that the middle and high schools cut physical education and sports classes next year. Instead, students will have classes for test preparation. Students will have three hours of test preparation a week. These test preparation classes will be all year long.
```

```markdown
Some people think it's wrong to have physical education and sports in schools, and the trend in many schools is to focus on helping students pass tests. I'm all for test preparation, but knowing how to stay physically healthy is as important as preparing for tests, and for that reason, I'm against cutting sports from schools.
