### 听力-识别填充语

#### 识别填充语

人们用 **you know** 和 **like** 等表达，以便自己在思考接下来将要说什么时避免沉默。 一般而言，填充语没有真正的含义，但必须能够识别填充语，才能专注于对方所说的真正内容。

- 以下是填充语的部分示例：
  - Ben's got tickets for that techno band - **you know**, Rokmo.
Jazz is the best. **I mean**, the music is so complex and unpredictable.
  - This music is, **like**, way too loud.
He was, **uh**, a DJ in high school.
- 语言注释： 你可以在交谈中使用填充语，使你的话语更加自然；但是，过度使用填充语可能听起来使人厌烦且重复。

### 阅读-音乐行业

如果能在阅读前预测其内容，你就能更好地理解一篇文章。 借助标题以及任何图片，猜测出文章的内容。 然后尝试预测可能遇到的词汇类型。

- 让我们来练习预测。 你即将阅读一篇题为 **Illegal Music** 的文章。 文章旁有一张有人正在非法下载的图片。 你认为以下哪些词语最有可能在此文中出现？
  - digital
  - prescription
  - earthquake
  - download
  - subscription
  - salty
- 如果选择 **digital**、**download** 和 **subscription**，那你的选择是正确的。所有这些单词均与非法下载音乐有关。

Illegal Music
By Jacki Mistry


More and more people are buying digital music, but companies are still making less and less profit. That's because music is often illegally downloaded from the internet. Songs are shared for free between people's computers – no one pays for them. "It's a serious problem for the music business," said Dan Coates, CEO at myTurn, an online music service.

In the 1990s, sales were supported by CDs. "But no one buys CDs anymore," says Coates.

To help stop illegal downloading, companies like myTurn are offering music subscriptions. The companies believe that if an inexpensive subscription is offered, people will be less interested in illegal downloading. Subscriptions are from $10 to $20 a month, and they're getting cheaper and cheaper.

I just heard a song by Chanti Smith called 'Walking on Clouds.' What a beautiful song! First, Chanti sings quiet, low notes. Then the melody changes, and she sings the high notes a little louder. She has a great range and lightly hits the high notes. You can't really dance to 'Walking on Clouds' because there isn't much of a beat. But the song has a relaxing mood with romantic lyrics. It made me think about how my boyfriend Logan and I first met. Anyway, you should listen to it. I really enjoyed it.

### 最终任务-撰写有关你听过的一首歌的文章

```markdown
I just listened to the song 'Home Improvement' by Josh Woodward. It's a folk-rock tune, and I think it's pretty catchy. I listened to it five times, and I can't get it out my head. Josh's voice is rough and edgy. He doesn't have much of a range, but he hits a few high notes. I was also a little confused. The mood of the song is kind of happy because of the quick, addictive beat. But I think that the lyrics are political, sad and sentimental. Very interesting! I recommend this music when you want a beat and some politics in one song.
```
