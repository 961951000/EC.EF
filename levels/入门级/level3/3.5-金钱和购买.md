  - attractive - unattractive

### 语法-形容词比较级

#### 形容词比较级

  - slow > slow**er than**
  - The desktop computer is **slower than** the laptop computer.
- 对于两个或两个以上的音节的形容词，用 **more** or **less + adjective + than**。形容词不变。
  - expensive > more expensive than / less expensive than
  - The laptop computer is **more expensive than** the desktop.
  - The desktop computer is **less expensive than** the laptop.
- 如果听者已经知道您在说什么了，那么句子中的 **than** 这个部分可以省掉。
  - My old computer is slow. I need something **faster**. (than my old computer)
  - A: You can buy a desktop or a laptop computer.
  - B: The laptop is **more expensive**. (than the desktop computer)

  - The price is decreasing **slowly**.
  - quick > quick**ly**

  - lazy > laz**ily**
