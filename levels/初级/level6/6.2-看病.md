I feel terrible. I didn't sleep last night because I had a bad fever. I was just too hot! I have a bad cough, too – maybe because I smoke? My colleagues always complain about the noise I make, but I can't answer them because I have a sore throat and I can't speak. I didn't eat all day because I felt nauseous and I had a stomachache, and every time I wanted to stand up, I couldn't because I was so dizzy.
