# 问题与解决办法

## 1-解释问题

### 个人问题

- 如果你无法放弃止做某事，你就是对它**addicted**，或你对它有了一种**addiction**，下面就是一些常见的沉溺。
  - He's **addicted to** cigarettes.
  - She's **addicted to** coffee.
  - They're **addicted to** gambling.
  - He's **addicted to** alcohol. He's an **alcoholic**.

### 了解大意

#### 阅读找出大意

```markdown
找出段落或文本的大意是一种重要的阅读技巧。大意是指梗概，不是具体细节。了解大意后，更容易理解文本。
你通常可以通过确定主题句来找出大意。主题句一般位于段首，但也可以出现在其他位置。
如果你不确定主题句，你可以通过用自己的话概括来得出文本大意。寻找重复的单词或观点来帮助概括。
确定大意时不可太狭隘，也不能太宽泛。一个陈述即便真实，但可能过于具体或笼统，不可能是大意。
```

```markdown
Poor John. He has a lot of personal problems. His job is very stressful. At night he can't stop thinking about his job, and he has terrible insomnia. He has marital problems because he drinks too much. And he's overweight because he doesn't exercise. John needs to make some changes.
```

### 谈论问题

- 在确定一个问题后，你可能想详细加以解释。以下是一些帮助你进行解释的表达。
  - I have insomnia. **The problem is that** I can't stop thinking about work.
  - She can't quit smoking. **One big problem is that** her husband smokes, too.
- that可省略而不会造成意义的改变。

Dear Paula,

Quitting smoking is very, very difficult. It's an addiction. Some people can't do it alone. My advice is that you ought to see your doctor. Your doctor can give you medicine to help.  Also, when you talk on the phone or drink coffee or alcohol, you had better eat something. That will keep your mouth busy.

Good luck!

Mary

## 3-解决员工问题

### 工作问题

- 与生活中其他方面一样，有时工作中也会碰到一些问题。一位员工可能需要与老板就以下方面谈话：
  - being late = tardiness
  - being disorganized
  - being lazy
  - being sloppy
  - being argumentative
  - being offensive
  - not being flexible
  - not following instructions
  - not working well with the team
  - not meeting deadlines

```markdown
JOSH: My boss  wanted to speak with me today. And it wasn't very nice.
PAM: What for  ?
JOSH: For not meeting my deadline  .
PAM: Oh, no. I'm sorry.
JOSH: Yeah, and also for being  argumentative.
PAM: Really? Well, you are a bit argumentative  – sometimes.
JOSH: Me? Argumentative? No way! I am not.
PAM: You see?
JOSH: What?
PAM: Did your boss mention anything else?
JOSH: Uh, yeah. He said I need to work on being more flexible  .
PAM: Yeah … Good luck with that.
```

### 'who' 引导的关系从句

- 用关系从句连接两个句子。关系从句使您的写作和讲话更流利，并帮助您避免重复。关系代词 **who** 用来指人。
  - We have a lot of engineers. The engineers work late.
  - We have a lot of engineers **who** work late.

在例子中，主句**We have a lot of engineers**是一个完整的句子。关系从句**who work late**不是一个完整的句子，故不能独立成句。

```markdown
You wouldn't believe the people I work with. I have a colleague who never cleans his desk. He is so sloppy. I have a manager who enjoys being offensive. It's just awful. And I have a boss who is never in the office. She's so lazy it's incredible.
```

### 讨论问题与解决办法

```markdown
LARRY: Come in. Ah, Pamela. Thank you for coming. Have a seat.
PAMELA: No problem. What's up?
LARRY: I asked you here  today to talk about the team.
PAMELA: What about the team?
LARRY: Well, I know you're a hard worker, but Paul told me that you don't work well with the team. He says you're argumentative. This is something we have to deal with. What's the story?
PAMELA: Excuse me, but Paul is offensive to all the women on the team.
LARRY: Okay. How is he offensive?
PAMELA: He's always making bad jokes about women. And last week, he called Anna fat. He's just so rude. You can ask any woman on the team.
LARRY: Really? Well, we have to figure out a solution  for this.
PAMELA: One solution could be  for you to talk to the team as a group, not just Paul or me.
LARRY: I think that's a good idea. Would tomorrow work for you?
PAMELA: Yes. Thank you very much.
```

  - Business is bad, and **employee morale** is low.
  - **Communication** between management and staff is poor.
  - There is a continuing problem of employee **theft** in the company.
  - The company's **costs** are going up and up.
  - **Competition** is fierce in our industry.
  - Because of terrible **mismanagement**, the company is in trouble.
  - The company's biggest problem is **a lack of innovation**.

```markdown
We need to talk to each other. Costs Communication Competition is important.

The team didn't meet its deadline due to first rate latest technology mismanagement.

We don't have the best products because of a lack of innovation costs theft.

Our costs thefts innovations are a problem. We need to spend less money.

Our morale mismanagement competition is weak. There aren't many companies like us.

The employees aren't happy. We need to improve their innovation morale cost.
```

```markdown
Our company has a number of problems. We need to have better communication between management and staff. If employee morale is poor, we will not do well. Also, a lack of innovation will make people not want to buy our products. We have to keep costs down so we have the money to buy the latest technology. We also have to watch what the competition is doing. We are not alone in this business.
```

### 'that' 引导的关系从句

- 用关系代词连接两个句子。用关系代词 **that** 代替事物。
  - I work for a company. The company has lots of problems.
  - I work for a company **that** has lots of problems.

在该例子中，主句 **I work for a company** 是一个完整句，关系从句 **that has lots of problems** 不是完整句，故不能单独成句。
记住，使用关系从句可以让你的作文和讲话更流畅，避免重复。

```markdown
The company I work for has a lot of problems. We have technology that's not the latest. I have a computer that's 10 years old. We have a management team that's disorganized. We have products that aren't innovative. We have competition that's doing better. We have costs that are rising quickly.
```

### 提出解决办法

- 使用类似表达来提出解决办法:

  - **Another possibility would be** to have a team meeting.
- 为了竭力提出解决方法，使用类似下列表达。
  - **I really think that the only solution is to** replace the entire management team.

  - **I strongly suggest that we** deal with this problem immediately.

### 公司问题

```markdown
The Clayton Harelson Company made beautiful motorcycles that were popular around the world. It cost a lot to make them in the US, so the motorcycles were expensive. Problems began when other companies, in other countries, started making similar motorcycles. Company management decided they had two choices. One solution was to move the factory to a less expensive country. Another possibility was to have fewer workers in the factory and spend a lot of money on the latest technology to make the motorcycles.
```

### 记述公司问题

```markdown
I worked for a company that made sunglasses. The glasses were really nice, but the employees weren't happy. The communication between management and employees was very bad. The boss didn't know what to do. Finally, the boss decided that the solution was to have a team meeting with management and employees every week. That was a very good idea. The communication got better, and employee morale also got better.
```
