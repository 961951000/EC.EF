```

```markdown
The purpose of today's meeting is to talk about our competition. Their increasing market share is a big problem for us. Overall, our revenue and profits are down. We have to find ways to improve our sales. We cannot delay. One thing we are thinking about is the purchase of one of our smaller competitors. They have a lot of strength in the South American region. We are also looking at several projects to improve efficiency.
```

### 表达-表达原因与结果

- 使用 **due to** 和 **because of** 描述原因。这些表达是从属子句的一部分。注意，当从属子句在独立分句前出现，它们之间要用逗号隔开。
  - **Because of** our purchase of Sunset Computers, they have some questions.
  - They have some questions **because of** our purchase of Sunset Computers.
  - **Due to** the purchase of Sunset Computers, our market share has increased.

  - Our costs have risen. **Consequently**, our profits are going to decrease slightly.

## 2-讨论可能的解决办法

### 词汇-更多商务词汇

```markdown
He was hired  as a developer six months ago, just before the hiring freeze  . He's working on a database with his project manager  to support the new software  . The software release is in six months. It's huge. They've already spent more than half a million  dollars. The company's customers  are very excited.
```

```markdown
We keep all the company information in a huge database.

My project manager does a great job for the team.

Do you know the date of the next release ?

No computer can operate without software .

A smart company should listen to its customers .

We'll need to hire six or seven new developers to complete the project.
```

### 语法-'think' 和 'believe' 引导的从句

- 含有 **think** 和 **believe** 的从句
  - 使用动词 **think** 和 **believe** 表达观点。注意，观点位于 **that** 从句，紧随动词之后。
    - I **think that** Joan did a good job.
    - Simon **believes that** we can save half a million dollars.
  - 单词 **that** 可以省略，意思不会有改变。
    - I **think** Joan did a good job.
    - Simon **believes** we can save half a million dollars.
  - 回答是或否的时，用 **so** 替代 **that** 从句，以避免重复整个短语。
    - A: Do you **think that** Joan did a good job?
    - B: Yes, I **think so**.
    - C: No, I **don't think so**.

```markdown
KAREN: So, John, what did you think  of the meeting?
JOHN: Well, I think that  the company has some problems.
KAREN: Because of  the hiring freeze?
JOHN: Yes, and I don't believe that  the software project is going well.
KAREN: Yeah, and the release is in two months. Do you think that  we can do it?
JOHN: I don't think so  .
KAREN: That's not good. Our customers are waiting.
JOHN: Yes. The project manager needs to do more.
```

### 表达-表达观点

#### 表达观点

- 表达观点有很多方法。比如说，你可以使用 **in my opinion** 和 **it's my feeling (that)** 这样的表达。
  - **In my opinion**, we could delay the software release.
  - **It's his feeling that** we need to cut costs.
- 你也可以使用 **I think** 和 **I believe** 。记住，这些从句里面 **that** 可用可不用。
  - **I don't believe that** we should lay off staff.
  - He **thinks** a hiring freeze is better than layoffs.

```markdown
SARAH: In my opinion  , we need to cut costs.
PAUL: Yes, but how?
SARAH: Well, I think that  we could save half a million dollars with layoffs.
PAUL: No, I don't believe that's  the best idea. It would hurt employee morale.
SARAH: So, what's your idea?
PAUL: It's my feeling  that a hiring freeze is the best way.
SARAH: Well, maybe, but it will take longer to save money.
```

### 表达-请求澄清和确认

#### 请求重复、澄清和确认

- 有时，当人们在展开讨论和表达观点时，可能有必要请求重复、澄清和确认。
  - 请求重复
    - I'm sorry – **could you repeat that?**
    - I'm sorry, but **I didn't catch that.**
    - I'm sorry – **would you mind repeating that?**
  - 请求澄清
    - **Do you mean that** you think it's a good idea?
    - **Are you saying** we should stop the project?
  - 请求确认
    - **So you think** he should be fired?
    - **So, just to confirm**, you believe that it's too expensive?
  - 你也可以重复对方说的话。
    - Half a million?

### 最终任务-讨论可能的解决办法

> 工作会议后，你正在和一位同事交谈。显然你的公司需要削减成本。你的同事认为公司应该裁员，你不同意。你认为公司应该暂停招聘来节省开支。

## 3-提出方案

### 词汇-动词变为名词

#### 动词变为名词

- 一些动词加上后缀后可变为名词。一些能把动词变为名词的后缀是：**-ion**, **-ing**, **-al**, **-ism**, **-ness**, **-ist**和 **-ity**。
  - discuss - discuss**ion**
  - suggest - suggest**ion**
  - hire - hir**ing**
  - save - sav**ings**
  - propose - propos**al**
- 有些名词看起来与他们的动词非常不同。如，think 的名词和该动词的过去式完全一样：
  - think - thought
- 另一方面，有些名词与其动词形式相同。
  - delay - delay
  - start - start
  - lay off - layoff
- 语言点：动词变名词并没有固定的规则，不是所有动词都能变为名词。你只需熟记这些不同的形式。

### 语法-'propose' 和 'suggest' 引导的从句

#### 'propose' 和 'suggest' 后的从句

- 用**propose** 和 **suggest** 动词提出建议。注意，两个动词后常接一个**that** 从句。
  - I **propose that** we delay the database project.
  - I **suggest that** we hire a new project manager.
- **that** 可以省略，没有意义的变化。
  - I **propose** we delay the database project.
  - I **suggest** we hire a new project manager.
- 两个动词 **propose** 和 **suggest** 说明可能性的概念，并且强调说话人即将要讲的内容。注意两个动词之后始终使用不带 **to** 的不定式，而且并不遵循主谓一致的规则。也就是说，**he**、**she** 或 **it** 后面的动词不需要加 **-s**。
  - I propose that he **delay** the project.
  - I suggest she **lay off** some staff.

```markdown
She is very sick. I suggest she go to the doctor.

He proposes that the company not give pay increases this year.

We need to save money. I propose we delay the project.

Employee morale is important. I suggest that we not have any layoffs.

I propose that he hire one new engineer. We need the help.
```

```markdown
RON: OK, so what are your ideas for saving money?
LINDA: Well, I have two proposals  . First, I propose that  we delay  the database project for six months.
RON: How much will that save us?
LINDA: Half a million  dollars.
RON: That's great! And your second idea?
LINDA: Well, I suggest  that the company not lay off any staff, and that we have a hiring freeze. In other words, as staff leaves, we don't replace them.
RON: Interesting.
```

### 表达-提出和回应方案

### 最终-任务提出方案

> 您的公司遇到财政问题，您的老板要辞退您的团队的一些职员。写一份反建议避免该事发生。 请听音频并录制 正确的回答。

## 4-撰写简短的商务方案

  - 首先，解释提案的目的。
    - **The purpose of this proposal is** to find a new location for our company offices.

    - **Because of** falling market share, **we have to find a way** to generate more sales.

```

### 表达-正式和非正式的语言

#### 对比正式用语与非正式用语

    - The purpose of this proposal is to outline a plan to cut expenses.

### 表达-利弊

#### 陈述优点和缺点

- 作为商业提案的一部分，您常常会加入对所提议解决方案的**advantages and disadvantages** 或 **pros and cons** 的分析。
  - **One advantage** is lower costs.
  - **Another pro** is that revenues will increase.
  - **One con**, however, is that we'll need to use staff more efficiently.
  - **A further disadvantage** is that projects will not be finished so quickly.
- 使用类似 **big** 和 **obvious** 在内的形容词强调优缺点的重要性。
  - Another **big** advantage of a hiring freeze is that we can keep morale high.

New office proposal
From:
john@efstudents.com
To: efstudent@efstudents.com
Hi, there.

Can you take a look at my proposal? I'm having problems with the executive summary. Can you help me write it?

Executive summary

???

Advantages and disadvantages

An obvious advantage of Office One is that the rent is cheaper. Another big advantage is that there are a lot of restaurants nearby, as well as a bus and train station. A big con of Office Bravo is that it's too far from the city.

Conclusion

Thanks for your help!
