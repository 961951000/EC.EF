### 语法-否定反意疑问句

#### 反意疑问句

- 反意疑问句是位于陈述句之后的小问句。使用反意疑问句确定某事真假或征求同意。

    - **You work** in marketing, **don't you?**
    - **You got** a degree in engineering, **didn't you?**
  - 如果句中有动词 **be**，或类似 **can** 或 **have** 的助动词，在反义疑问句中用该动词。
    - **You are** the new sales manager, **aren't you?**
    - **He was** late, **wasn't he?**
    - **You can** speak Arabic, **can't you?**

### 词汇-对话话题

#### 对话话题

- 对话话题合适与否，并没有固定规则。这往往取决于文化、社会和个人观点。因此，与不熟悉的人交谈时，还是谨慎为好。
  - 努力避免谈及诸如 **politics**、**religion**、**money** 或 **romance** 之类可能引起强烈反应的话题。相反，选择你认为对方可能感兴趣又不会触犯对方的话题。
    - A: What kind of **sports** do you like?
    - B: I'm a big soccer fan.
    - A: Did you see the game last night?
    - B: Yes! It was really exciting, wasn't it?

    - B: Yes, it is. I love the summer here.

### 口语-闲聊寒暄

BILLY: No, my wife had to stay home with the kids, unfortunately.
LINDA: Oh, that's too bad. Hey, let me introduce you to my husband, Frank. He's right over there. He can give you some excellent advice about Athens. He's a travel agent.
BILLY: OK. Sounds good.
```

### 表达-找出共识

MARIA: Cool! Did she order any services?
JONAS: No, but she'll probably place an order.
MARIA: That's great. Bobby Baber seemed interested, too.

MARIA: I know, I know. He's weird. But last night he said that our company looks really strong.
JONAS: Wow. OK, well, I guess that Bobby Baber was feeling a little guilty about what he said last time.

```markdown
Networking party about health costs
From:
nick.stevens@upoweru.com
To: cassandra@cityhealth.com; joseph@healthykid.net
Hi, Cassandra and Joe.

I went to a fantastic networking party this weekend at the General Hospital in Luxembourg. More than 20 city healthcare executives were there. The executives shared great ideas about how to decrease healthcare costs. The best idea was probably a free health advice website. People seemed excited about my course for doctors, too.

I'll tell you more when I see you next week!

Best regards,

Nick
```

```markdown
Summary A:

I just got back from the networking event at the Edison. I guess it was a success. Will anyone call me? Maybe Anthony. Everyone was happy and friendly. Maybe that's because the event took place near the beach!

Summary B:

I guess that he liked my ideas about web design. And it was so cool that the event was in Hawaii. What a fancy place. It was right next to the beach. I think that Anthony Cleo will call. I'd probably go again next year. It was at the Edison.

Summary C:(best)

I went to a very cool networking event at the Edison in Hawaii last week. A large group of executives met to share ideas about web marketing. I think that I made some great contacts, and Anthony Cleo at RSL really liked my web design ideas.
