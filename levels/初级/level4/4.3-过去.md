  - walk - walk**ed**

- **否定式:** 使用 **did + not** 来组成动词过去时否定式。主要动词保持原形。

  - **Did** they **eat** dinner?
- 要使用 **be** 动词组成过去时疑问句，请将 **was** 或 **were** 置于问句之首。

### 表达-过去时间的表达

使用下列表达来谈论过去的事情。

- '**Yesterday**'
  - I visited Carol **yesterday**.
- '**The day before yesterday**'
  - Jack and Nancy got back from Mexico **the day before yesterday**.
- **数字 + 时间单词 + ago**
  - We went to that new restaurant **two days ago**.
- **last + 时间单词**
  - I worked at a supermarket **last year**.

```markdown
JENNY: Todd, it's good to see you again. How are you doing?
TODD: Fine, Jenny! I just got back from Tokyo two days ago.
JENNY: Business trip?
TODD: Yeah.
JENNY: How was it?
TODD: It was good, but Tokyo's so busy!
JENNY: Yeah.
TODD: Oh, and I was in Kyoto last week.
JENNY: Uh-huh? And how was that?
TODD: It was incredible! So how are you?

TODD: Really?
JENNY: Yeah, I had dinner with Mark and Paula.
TODD: How are they doing?
JENNY: They're fine. Oh, you know they had a baby, right?
TODD: No, I didn't know.
JENNY: Yeah, it was last year.
TODD: Wow. I should call them.
JENNY: Good idea.
```

### 表达-询问过去的事件/活动

- 开放式问题和封闭式问题
  - 开放式问题是指答案不止一个的问题。比如，**How was Paris?** 有多种可能的回答。
    - How was Paris?
    - It was great!
    - It was terrible.
    - We loved it.
    - We hated it.
  - 封闭式问题则只有肯定和否定两种回答：**yes** 或 **no**。
    - Did you go to Paris?
    - Yes, I did.
    - No, I didn't.
  - 开放式问题一般更利于推动对话。它们让和你对话的人可以自由回答，回答方法也有多种。开放式问题主要分为两种：描述性问题和意见性问题。
- 描述性问题
  - What was it like?
  - What was the wedding like?
  - What did he look like?
- 意见性问题
  - How did you like Beijing?
  - How was your vacation?
  - How was Russia?
- 语言点：谨慎使用单词 **like**，该词有两种不同的意思。
  - 描述：What was it **like**?
  - 观点：How did you **like** it?

## 2-谈论你的周末

### 语法-不规则动词的过去时

许多动词的过去时形式都是不规则的，也就是说它们的过去时形式不能通过简单在词尾添加 **-ed** 形成。

- 有些不规则动词的过去时和现在时截然不同，必须加以熟记。
  - go - **went**
  - eat - **ate**
  - bring - **brought**
  - leave - **left**
  - sell - **sold**
- 其他不规则动词的过去时形式只是改变了一个字母，因此更容易识记。
  - make - **made**
  - rise - **rose**
  - get - **got**
- 一些动词的一般现在时和过去时的形式相同。
  - cut - **cut**
  - let - **let**
  - shut - **shut**
- 动词 **read** 的一般现在时和过去时拼法相同，但读音不同。请听这两句中 **read** 的读音。
  - I often **read** novels.
  - I **read** a good novel last week.

### 词汇-过去的活动

### 口语-开启对话

开启对话有多种方法。

- **一般性问题:** 如果没有想要谈论的话题，问候完后你可以使用一个常见的一般性问题。
  - How are you doing?
  - How are you today?
  - What's up?
  - What's happening?
  - What's going on?
  - How was your weekend?
- **特定问题:** 你可以向你认识的人询问他们的生活。
  - How was Peru?
  - How is your mom feeling?
**陈述句:** 在有些场合，你会有一个你想讨论的话题。你可以提出陈述，然后听众会对你的陈述发表意见。
  - A: Hey, there was a great movie on last night.
  - B: Really? What was it?
  - A: That was a great game last night!
  - B: Yeah, it was really exciting!

```markdown
It's Monday morning. You are talking to Jane, a colleague at work. Her husband Fred was sick last week. You both love comedies. You saw a wonderful comedy in the theater last night. You and Jane do not like sports.
```

### 表达-改变话题

对话从一个话题转到另一个话题，有一些表达可以帮助人们暗示他们要改变话题。

- **By the way:** 使用表达 **by the way** 来引入新话题，它也表示你刚想起了某事。
  - A: **By the way**, I saw Joe last night. He looked good.
  - B: Really? I'm so glad!
- **That reminds me:** 当你想起了想说的其他事情，使用 **that reminds me** 来转变话题。
  - A: There was a great baseball game on TV last night.
  - B: Oh, **that reminds me**. I have two tickets to tonight's game. Do you want to go?
  - A: Yeah!
- **Anyway:** 使用单词 **anyway** 来结束或总结话题，这样一来你可以开始一个新话题。当你听厌了某人谈论某事，非常想改变话题时，就可以使用这个词。
  - A: That restaurant wasn't very good.
  - B: No, it wasn't! The meat tasted bad, and the salad wasn't fresh. And the waiter was awful! His clothes were dirty!
  - A: **Anyway**, we're not going there again. So, how's Jane?

```markdown
JERRY: Jessica, how was your weekend?
JESSICA: Oh, hi, Jerry! The weekend was great! On Friday night, Jim and I flew  down to Acapulco.
JERRY: You went to Mexico for the weekend?
JESSICA: Yeah. It's only a short flight from here. The beaches were fantastic and the food, well, it was amazing – fresh fish and delicious fruit every day!
JERRY: Wow! It does sound amazing.
JESSICA: Yeah, and it wasn't expensive. The hotel was pretty cheap. Anyway, it was a lot of fun – and relaxing, too. So, how was your weekend?
JERRY: It was OK. On Saturday night, Kerstin and I went to a party at a friend's house.
JESSICA: Oh, that reminds me. Jim and I are having people over next weekend on, uh, Sunday afternoon. Of course, we want you and Kerstin to come.
JERRY: Thanks! I really want to meet Jim.
JESSICA: And, by the way, we have a meeting at 9 o'clock with Harry and his team.
JERRY: Really?
JESSICA: Yeah, and it's 8:55 now.
JERRY: Oh. Well, see you at the meeting.
JESSICA: Yeah!
```

Jenny,

I'm visiting a friend in New Orleans. It's a beautiful city. I love the buildings and the people. I'm having a good time, but a thief broke into my friend's apartment and stole $130! That's a lot of money. We called the police, and they are looking for the thief. I'm going home to Springdale tomorrow, and that's OK with me. I'm really upset about the theft.

Sarah
```

### 语法-不定代词

- 有些代词并不指代某个已知的名词，它们就是不定代词，包括以下三个单词。
  - somewhere
  - someone
  - something
- 使用 **somewhere** 谈论不确定的地点。
  - John lives **somewhere** in Tokyo. I don't know his address.
- 使用 **someone** 谈论不确定或不知道的人。
  - **Someone** stole a painting from the museum.
- 使用 **something** 谈论不确定的事物。

语言点：单词 **somebody** 与 **someone** 意义相同。

```

### 表达-排列叙事的顺序

#### 故事排序

在讲故事或写故事时，将事情发生的顺序理清很重要。理清顺序有几种方法。

- 如果你描述的事情在另一件事情一天之后发生，使用短语 **the next day**。
  - They stole 15 computers on Friday night. **The next day**, the police came.
- 要表示一件事情在某事多久之后发生，使用数字 **+** 时间单词 **+ later**。
  - There was a theft on Friday night. **Three days later**, we hired a security guard.
- 向他人讲述某件发生的事情，你也可以使用本课中之前学到的时间表达。
  - The theft was three days **ago**.
  - They broke in **last** Friday.
  - They stole money **the day before yesterday**.

### 阅读-预览新闻文章

- 预览新闻文章
  - 随着你的英语更加熟练，你将开始阅读难度更大的文字，比如新闻和杂志文章。这时培养理解这些文字的策略很重要。一种有用的策略是在开始阅读故事前先预览或通看整篇文章。以下是一些具体步骤，将让你的阅读更加具有效率。
- 标题
  - 标题以一种特有的简短英语形式撰写，因此起初可能会难以理解。例如，标题 **U.K.**, **U.S.** **Talk Trade** 表示英美两国协商贸易问题。由于标题涵盖文章大意，尤其应该引起你的注意。
- 照片和插图
  - 照片和插图置于文中，可以让文章更容易理解，增加阅读趣味。慢慢仔细观看照片和图片。如果图片配有文字说明，阅读这些说明，获取更多有关图片和故事的信息。
- 导语
  - 新闻文章的第一段称为导语，通常包含该新闻最重要的细节。导语常常引出人物、时间、时间和地点，有时也会介绍方式和原因。由于导语信息充分，因此你应该密切关注。
- 新闻来源
  - 在文章上方，你可能看到至少下列一项：署名行（记者姓名）、日期栏（记者发稿的城市）和通讯社的名称。有时通讯社的名称见于括号中 **(Global News)**，有时缩写为 **(GN)**。

```markdown

## 4-听故事

### 词汇-远足词汇

### 语法-提问过去时态的问题

#### 含有疑问词的过去时疑问句

  - A: **How was** your weekend?

KYLE: Wow! The Appalachian Trail! How far did you hike?
JANE: In five days, we hiked about 25 kilometers.
KYLE: Wow! That's pretty far. How cold  did it get?
JANE: Well, you know it's October, so it was really cold at night.
KYLE: What kind of tent did you take?
JANE: No tent. There are little cabins on the trail. We all slept in them.
KYLE: Really? What kind of animals did you see? Any bears?
JANE: No bears. Just a lot of deer.
KYLE: That's good.
```

### 表达-积极聆听

听故事不应该完全被动接受。与通常的对话相同，你应避免沉默，激发讲故事的人，不懂得时候要提问。做一个积极的聆听者。

- 常常可以通过询问故事接下来的事情来激发讲故事的人。使用下列表达询问之后发生的事情：
  - And then what happened?
  - What happened next?
  - What did you do then?
  - Go on.
- 请记住，升调可以将陈述句变为疑问句。使用类似下面的问题确定你理解了或表达惊奇。
  - Bears?
  - A problem with a bear?
  - And we're going to the same place?
- 最好的故事会故事讲述人和听故事的人应该互动，从而营造一场难忘的活动。
