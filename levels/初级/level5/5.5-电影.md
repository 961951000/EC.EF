JENNY: I just saw another Joseph Fiennes movie.
LUCAS: Which one? Is it an action movie?
JENNY: Uh, 'Shakespeare in Love.' It's a romantic comedy. But I think that there's some good history in it, too. It's funny because Shakespeare can't think of any good ideas. I thought it was quite entertaining.
LUCAS: Me, too. I don't usually like romances, but that's one of my favorite movies. It's an old one.
JENNY: Yeah, it's quite old, but it's still good.
LUCAS: Mm-hmm. Did you watch it with your kids?

'The Artist' is just like one of those old films. This romance was made in gorgeous black and white and takes place in the 1920s. And, just like the old films, there's no talking. There are only a few subtitles. But it's certainly not a remake of one of the old films from the 1920s. Remember how some of those old movies had really bad acting? Well, the acting in 'The Artist' is brilliant, and actor Berenice Bejo is incredible. This movie also has an original plot. 'The Artist' shows us what happens when a famous person has really bad luck. I won't tell you how it ends – see 'The Artist' for yourself.

Comedies are more evil poor fun than horror movies.

TIM: Wow. Amazing. 'Shaun of the Dead.' I can't believe that movie was made with so little money.
MEGAN: Oh? How much money did they spend?
TIM: $6.1 million. It seemed like it was created for $50 million.
MEGAN: But $6.1 million is a lot of money!
TIM: Not really. Most Hollywood films cost, like, $100 million, or more.
MEGAN: Huh. How did they do it?
TIM: Well, it was directed by Edgar Wright. He's brilliant.
MEGAN: Yeah?
TIM: He said they weren't given much money, and they were told to spend it
carefully. So he was really careful and worked really hard.

### 阅读-阅读影评

#### 推断

- 文本中，事实和观点往往并不直接说明。在这种情况下，你必须做出推断。推断是一种猜测。
  - Gene Kelly did a great job in the movie 'Singin' in the Rain'! He's an excellent dancer.
- 作者并没有直接说 Gene Kelly 在影片 'Singin' in the Rain' 有跳舞，但因为两个关于电影和 Gene Kelly 的句子前后相邻，我们可以推断他在电影中跳过舞。
  - 'The Class' is a great movie. It was made in France.
- 作者并没有直接说影片 'The Class' 中讲哪种语言，但由于影片在法国制作，我们可以推断它是法语影片。

'A Simple Life' was made in Hong Kong. It was directed by Ann Hui. It's about an old woman, but there's never a dull moment. It's very different from big Hollywood action movies.

I don't like baseball, but 'Moneyball' was a very interesting movie. The story is a little dark. You learn some dreadful things about sports, but 'Moneyball' has a happy ending. 'Moneyball' is about the Oakland A's general manager, the famous Billy Beane. Beane wasn't given much money. He had to get creative. Billy Beane was played by Brad Pitt, and 'Moneyball' was directed by Bennett Miller. I think that actors always do a good job when they work with Bennett Miller.

### 最终任务-描述一部电影

```markdown
I just saw 'Rear Window.' What an amazing movie! 'Rear Window' was made in 1954 and was directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock. 'Rear Window' is a dark story, like most Hitchcock movies. L.B. is played by James Stewart. L.B. is a photographer, but his leg is broken. He has to stay home, so he watches his neighbors through their windows. I felt sorry for his poor neighbors! Soon, L.B. begins using his camera to fight evil. I saw the remake in 1998, but it's not the same. Daryl Hannah's acting was dreadful!
