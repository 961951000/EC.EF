## 2-抵达餐厅

### 表达-入座

#### *waiter* 的不同说法

- 传统上来讲，在餐厅里如果向您提供服务的是男士则被称为 **waiter**，如果是女士则称为 **waitress**。然而，随着英语越来越中性化，通常在餐厅里向您提供服务的男士和女士都一律称为 **waiters**。
- 您还可以使用另一个中性词 **server**。该词适用于表达站在柜台后面的人，或等您点餐的人，或把食物送到您餐桌上的人。

### 词汇-一顿饭的各部分

#### 一顿饭的各部分

- 在说英语国家的绝大部分餐馆，一份 **starter** 或 **appetizer** 是开餐的一小碟食物，包括类似这样的食品：
  - mushroom soup
  - Caesar salad
  - fresh oysters
  - shrimp cocktail
- 一个 **main course** 或 **entree** 是一餐饭的主菜。这将包括类似这样的东西：
  - roasted chicken with vegetables
  - steak and baked potato
  - fresh fish with rice
- **dessert** 通常是在饭后吃的一碟甜食，常配茶或咖啡吃。这包括这些东西：
  - apple pie
  - chocolate mousse
  - lemon sorbet

您的侍者也许会给您介绍餐馆提供的 **specials**，也许没有列在菜单上。 **specials** 也许包括餐饮的任何部分。只有在一年的某个时段才能提供的新鲜的当地水果就是很好的例子，

### 语法-'Some' 和 'any'

#### *Some* 和 *any*

  - Do you have **any** lemon sorbet?
- 在否定句中用 **any** 表示您没有某物。
  - No, we don't have **any** salad this evening.
  - I'm sorry. We don't have **any** shrimp cocktail today.

Restaurant review
Serene Grill

by Carey Smith

Serene Grill is a great choice for dinner. Their specialty is steak, but they serve many other excellent entrees like roasted chicken and grilled salmon. My favorite is the salmon. There is also a great selection of appetizers. The shrimp cocktail is very popular, and the restaurant is famous for its fresh oysters. The desserts are delicious and authentic. You can choose from apple pie with vanilla ice cream to chocolate cake with fresh strawberries. Prices are reasonable, and the servers are friendly. Outdoor seating is available in the summer, and parking is free before 9 p.m.

The Great Wall is my favorite restaurant. They serve authentic Chinese food. They have many different appetizers and entrees. The shrimp soup is an excellent appetizer, and the spicy beef entree is delicious. The restaurant is noisy, but all the servers are friendly and everybody has fun. The prices are very reasonable – most entrees are between $10 and $15. Desserts are not their specialty, but they always have ice cream. The restaurant is very busy on the weekends, so make a reservation.
